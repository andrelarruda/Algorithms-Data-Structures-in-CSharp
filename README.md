# Algorithms and Data Structures in C#

---

## Objective

This repository was created to save my studies on Algorithms and Data Structure with C#, simple but very important concepts for programming.  
The code snippets here were created following the "Data Structures and Algorithms in C# 2022" YouTube tutorial by Teddy Smith (https://www.youtube.com/@TeddySmithDev).

## Basic definitions

### Linked Lists

Is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference (link) to the next node in the list.


### Stacks

Is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.  
The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out).  
LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.  

Operations:  
- Push: Inserts a new item to the top.  
- Pop: Removes an item from the top.  
- Peek: Gets the element that's currently at the top.

### Queues

A data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.  

Characteristics  
- Queue can handle multiple data.  
- We can access both ends.  
- They are fast and flexible.
